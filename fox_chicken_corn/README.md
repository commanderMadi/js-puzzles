Help the farmer move a fox, a chicken, and a bag of corn across the river in his tiny boat â€¦ without anything getting eaten!

ðŸ¥… Objective

- Move all three items from the start bank to the destination bank.
- The farmer can take only one item at a time in the boat.

Whenever the farmer leaves a bank, if fox + chicken or chicken + corn are left alone together, disaster strikes and you lose.
